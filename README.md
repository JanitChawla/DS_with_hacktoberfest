#include <iostream>
using namespace std; 
int stack[100], n=100, top=-1;
void push(int val) {
   if(top>=n-1)
      cout<<"Stack Overflow"<<endl; 
   else {
      top++;
      stack[top]=val;
   }
}
void pop() {
   if(top<=-1)
      cout<<"Stack Underflow"<<endl;
   else {
      cout<<"The popped element is "<< stack[top] <<endl;
      top--;
   }
}
void display() {
   if(top>=0) {
      cout<<"Stack elements are:";
      for(int i=top; i>=0; i--)
         cout<<stack[i]<<" ";
         cout<<endl;
   } else
      cout<<"Stack is empty";
}
int main() {
   int ch, val; 
   cout<<"1) Push in stack"<<endl;
   cout<<"2) Pop from stack"<<endl;
   cout<<"3) Display stack"<<endl;
   cout<<"4) Exit"<<endl;
   do {
      cout<<"Enter choice: "<<endl;
      cin>>ch;
      switch(ch) {
         case 1: {   
            cout<<"Enter value to be pushed:"<<endl;
            cin>>val;
            push(val);
            break;
         }
         case 2: {
            pop();
            break;
         }
         case 3: {
